const aboutMe =
  "I'm Henk Bourgonje, a software engineer based in Groningen, The Netherlands. I have about four years of professional experience in backend engineering and I am currently expanding my knowledge on the front end, partly by having made this portfolio website. Over the last four years, I've had the opportunity to work for large companies as well as a fast growing scale-up called Klippa, at which I am currently building the backend for a brand new platform in Go.";
