    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      I'm Henk Bourgonje, a software engineer based in Groningen, The
      Netherlands. I have about four years of professional experience in backend
      engineering and I am currently expanding my knowledge on the front end,
      partly by having made this portfolio website. Over the last four years,
      I've had the opportunity to work for large companies as well as a fast
      growing scale-up called Klippa, at which I am currently building the
      backend for a brand new platform in Go.
